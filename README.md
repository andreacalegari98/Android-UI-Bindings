# NearIt-UI for Android
NearIt-UI is an open-source library that provides customizable UI bindings on top of the core [NearIt](https://github.com/nearit/Android-SDK) SDK.
This library aims to minimize the effort needed to create the UI for NearIt contents and dialogs.
Using NearIt-UI, a developer can launch a dialog to request location/bluetooth permissions to the user via a few lines of code.
